# encryption

Before running the script, make sure you have 'pycryptodomex' installed.
You can install it by using a command:
pip3 install pycryptodomex

1. When first running the program, select 'generate keys' option in order to generate your pair of keys. 
   Keys are saved in separated files in folder where your program is.
   
2. Send your public key to your fren.
   He will set that key as 'encryption key' to encrypt you messages.
   
3. Select option [3] for setting up encryption key and paste the key you get from your peer.
   That key will be used to encrypt messages before sending them to your friend.
   
4. Encrypt and decrypt messages using options.

It is highly recommended to periodically generate new keys so that in case of encryption break at least a part of messages remain safe.
